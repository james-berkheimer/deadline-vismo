This is an example of how to run code when Deadline performs a house cleaning
phase. You can trigger it manually in the Monitor in the 'Tools' menu for
testing (Create a 'Console' panel from the view menu).

More docs here: http://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com

Just use the dropdown to find the "Scripting Reference" for Deadline.

If you have problems, send an e-mail to support@thinkboxsoftware.com
or go over to the forums. Lots of helpful folks over there.

The notes are helpful. Read them. Especially if you want to use CPython.

Notes:
=====================================
You'll notice everything has the same name. The main folder, and the files
inside it, etc. That's required. One day we might change that, but for now,
that's how she be.

Copy this guy to 'custom/events' folder in the root of the repository and
start coding.
